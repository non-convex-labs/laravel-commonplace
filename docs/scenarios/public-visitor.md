# Scenarios — Public-read visitor

An unauthenticated reader who hits the optional public-read route group at `{prefix}/public/{path}`. Sees only notes with `visibility=public`. Everything else — listings, search, graph, editing, version history — stays behind the authenticated routes.

Assumptions:

- `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_ENABLED=true`, default middleware `web` (no auth).
- Alice owns `public/handbook` (`visibility=public`) and `projects/launch` (`visibility=private`).
- No session, no Sanctum token, no cookie.

## Happy path

### S-PUB-01 — `GET /commonplace/public/{path}` renders public notes

**Intent.** Public visitors get an HTML view of any `visibility=public` note. The route renders the minimal `commonplace::public.show` template (separate from the authenticated owner's template) so it doesn't ship private-vault chrome to unauthenticated readers. See [S-PUB-01b](#s-pub-01b--public-template-does-not-expose-authenticated-only-chrome) for the precise template contract.

**Preconditions.** `public/handbook` is public.

**Steps.**
1. `GET /commonplace/public/public/handbook`.

**Expected.**
- 200 OK.
- HTML response rendering the note's content via the package's CommonMark pipeline.
- No private-vault affordances (no edit link, no header search, no graph view) — those are behind the authenticated layout.

**Verify with.** `curl -i` and inspect status + rendered markup.

### S-PUB-02 — `GET /commonplace/public/raw/{path}` returns plain text

**Intent.** Mirrors the authenticated `/raw/{path}` endpoint but without auth. Useful for syndication, search engines, scrape-friendly mirrors.

**Preconditions.** `public/handbook` is public.

**Steps.**
1. `GET /commonplace/public/raw/public/handbook`.

**Expected.**
- 200 OK with `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`.
- The body is the raw markdown source (frontmatter included).

**Verify with.** `curl -I` to confirm headers, `curl` to inspect body.

**Source.** [http-api.md → Public-read routes](../http-api.md#public-read-routes), `PublicNoteController`.

---

### S-PUB-01b — Public template does not expose authenticated-only chrome

**Intent.** The public-read view is for unauthenticated readers. Affordances that require login (Edit, Delete, Download, the top-nav links to Search / Graph / New / Notes-index) should not appear on a public page. The "View markdown" link must point at the public-raw URL, not the auth-gated one. Enforced by tests in `tests/Feature/Http/PublicNoteControllerTest.php`.

**Preconditions.** Public-read enabled. `public/handbook` is public.

**Steps.**
1. Unauthenticated `GET /commonplace/public/public/handbook`.
2. Parse the response HTML.

**Expected.**
- No `<a>` to `/commonplace/edit/*`.
- No `<button>` or `<form>` performing `DELETE` against the note.
- No `<a>` to `/commonplace/raw/*` (the auth-gated raw route).
- If a "View markdown" affordance is present, it points at `/commonplace/public/raw/{path}` (the public-raw route, which returns 200 without auth).
- No `<a>` to `/commonplace/search`, `/commonplace/graph`, `/commonplace/create`, or `/commonplace` (the authenticated index).
- The breadcrumb (if rendered) shows the note's actual path, not a broken stem.

**Verify with.** `curl` + assertion on absent hrefs; or Playwright `evaluate` over `document.querySelectorAll('a, button')` filtering by href / action.

## Privacy boundary

### S-PUB-03 — Private notes return 404, not 403

**Intent.** Returning 403 would confirm a note exists at that path. The package returns 404 to deny path enumeration.

**Preconditions.** `projects/launch` is private. No share row for an anonymous caller (impossible anyway — Share requires a user_id).

**Steps.**
1. `GET /commonplace/public/projects/launch`.
2. `GET /commonplace/public/never-existed`.

**Expected.** Both return 404. Same status, same shape, no information leak.

**Verify with.** `curl -i` both URLs.

**Source.** [http-api.md → Public-read routes](../http-api.md#public-read-routes), [`PublicNoteController.php:62`](../src/Http/Controllers/PublicNoteController.php#L62), [auth.md → Public-read mode](../auth.md#public-read-mode).

---

### S-PUB-04 — Public-read does not expose listing, search, or graph

**Intent.** Read-by-known-path is intentionally the only operation. There is no way to enumerate which paths exist.

**Preconditions.** Public-read enabled.

**Steps.**
1. `GET /commonplace/public/` (root).
2. `GET /commonplace/public/search?q=anything`.
3. `GET /commonplace/public/graph`.
4. `GET /commonplace/public/api/graph`.

**Expected.** Each returns 404 (these routes simply aren't registered for the public group).

**Verify with.** `curl -i` each URL.

**Source.** [http-api.md → Public-read routes](../http-api.md#public-read-routes).

---

### S-PUB-05 — Public-read does not expose write, edit, delete, move

**Intent.** Mutation paths are entirely absent from the public route group.

**Preconditions.** Public-read enabled.

**Steps.**
1. `POST /commonplace/public/`.
2. `PUT /commonplace/public/public/handbook`.
3. `DELETE /commonplace/public/public/handbook`.

**Expected.** Each returns 405 or 404 (depending on Laravel's method matcher behavior with the unregistered verbs). Specifically, **not** 419 — that would mean the request reached the web/CSRF middleware on the authenticated side.

**Verify with.** `curl -i` each.

**Source.** [http-api.md → All routes](../http-api.md#all-routes).

## Opt-in toggle

### S-PUB-06 — With `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_ENABLED=false`, the public group isn't registered

**Intent.** Public-read is opt-in. With the toggle off, all URLs under the (default *or* overridden) public prefix return 404 from the framework. The prefix is reserved package-wide regardless of toggle state — a vault note at path `public/X` is therefore not reachable via `/commonplace/public/X` even for the authenticated owner. Operators who need that vault path back can move the public group to a non-conflicting prefix via `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_PREFIX`.

**Preconditions.** `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_ENABLED=false`. `public/handbook` still has `visibility=public`.

**Steps.**
1. `GET /commonplace/public/public/handbook` (unauthenticated).

**Expected.** 404.

**Verify with.** `curl -i`.

**Source.** [http-api.md → Public-read routes](../http-api.md#public-read-routes), `config/commonplace.php`.

---

### S-PUB-07 — Custom public middleware applies to both public routes

**Intent.** `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_MIDDLEWARE` controls the stack on the public group. Useful for rate-limiting or geoblocking.

**Preconditions.** `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_MIDDLEWARE=web,throttle:30,1`.

**Steps.**
1. Hit `GET /commonplace/public/public/handbook` 31 times in quick succession.

**Expected.** The first 30 return 200; the 31st returns 429.

**Verify with.** Shell loop + `curl`.

**Source.** [http-api.md → Public-read routes](../http-api.md#public-read-routes), [auth.md → Public-read mode](../auth.md#public-read-mode).

## Route precedence

### S-PUB-08 — `/public/*` does not collide with the authenticated catch-all

**Intent.** The public group is registered **before** the authenticated catch-all (`GET /{path}`), so a public URL doesn't get caught by the auth layer and redirected to login.

**Preconditions.** Public-read enabled. Auth guard set.

**Steps.**
1. Unauthenticated `GET /commonplace/public/public/handbook`.

**Expected.** 200 OK rendering the public note. **Not** a 302 to `/login`.

**Verify with.** `curl -i` without cookies; confirm no `Location: /login` header.

**Source.** [http-api.md → Public-read routes](../http-api.md#public-read-routes), [`routes/web.php:24-41`](../routes/web.php#L24-L41).

---

### S-PUB-09 — A note named `public/something-else` resolves under the auth group too

**Intent.** The literal first path segment `public` is overloaded: it's both the public-read route prefix segment **and** a legal folder name. When authenticated, the regular `GET /commonplace/public/something-else` should resolve through the auth catch-all (note view / folder fallback), not the public group.

**Preconditions.** Authenticated as Alice. Note exists at `public/handbook` (`visibility=private`, for this scenario, to highlight the precedence).

**Steps.**
1. As Alice, authenticated: `GET /commonplace/public/handbook`.

**Expected.** ... actually a known ambiguity. The public group's `/public/{path}` matches first; visiting `/commonplace/public/handbook` will hit `PublicNoteController` even when authenticated, and 404 if the note isn't `visibility=public`. The authenticated path to a note literally named `public/handbook` is `/commonplace/public/handbook` — same URL — so the public group precedence shadows the authenticated route for any folder named `public`.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a real edge worth verifying against running code. The docs imply route precedence is settled but don't call out that `public/` as a vault folder name conflicts with the public-read prefix. If your vault uses `public/` as a folder for `visibility=public` notes, the behavior is consistent (the public group handles it). If you use `public/` as a folder for *private* notes, those notes won't render under the authenticated routes via that URL. The mitigation is [S-PUB-10](#s-pub-10--commonplace_public_routes_prefix-moves-the-public-group-off-of-public) — move the public group to a non-colliding prefix.

**Verify with.** Try both — same URL, with and without auth — and confirm the 404 vs 200 outcomes.

**Source.** [http-api.md → All routes](../http-api.md#all-routes).

### S-PUB-10 — `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_PREFIX` moves the public group off of `/public`

**Intent.** Adopters whose vaults use `public/` as a legal folder name can override the prefix so the public-read group lives at a different segment (e.g. `commonplace/share/`). The authenticated catch-all then handles `public/*` URLs without the public group shadowing them.

**Preconditions.** Public-read enabled. A note exists at vault path `public/private-thing` with `visibility=private`. A second note exists at `public/handbook` with `visibility=public`.

**Steps.**
1. With default config — `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_PREFIX` unset — confirm S-PUB-09's shadowing applies.
2. Set `COMMONPLACE_PUBLIC_ROUTES_PREFIX=commonplace/share`. Run `php artisan route:clear` (and `route:cache` if cached).
3. Unauthenticated `GET /commonplace/share/public/handbook`.
4. Unauthenticated `GET /commonplace/public/handbook`.
5. Authenticated (as the owner) `GET /commonplace/public/private-thing`.

**Expected.**
- (3) 200 with the public note rendered — the public group now lives at `share/`.
- (4) 302 → `/login` (the URL is no longer in the public group, so it falls into the authenticated catch-all; unauth gets redirected). Authenticated, the same URL returns the public note via the auth catch-all.
- (5) 200 — the authenticated route can now reach private notes under `public/` because the public group no longer shadows them.

**Verify with.** `curl -i` each URL with and without cookies; `php artisan route:list | grep share` confirms the prefix change took effect.
